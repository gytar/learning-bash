# learning-bash

this repo will trace my bash journey. I'm learning bash from these websites 

- [TLDP Bash Advanced Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/)
- [Bobbyiliev introduction's to bash scripting](https://github.com/bobbyiliev/introduction-to-bash-scripting)

In parralel, I'm using vim and learning the most commonly used shortcuts to navigate, edit and select text. My main inspirations for VIM are : 

- [Devhint vim cheetsheet](https://devhints.io/vim)
- [Primeagen tutorial for VIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrMRyXtiJkc)
- [Awesome for nim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim/blob/main/README.md)
